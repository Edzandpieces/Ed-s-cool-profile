## Background
Created as part of an introductory exercise to HTML and CSS, this project is a simple intro page to me! I went for a bit of a 80's retrowave type of vibe to my site, as I'm a big fan of all things 80's and I love the whole vibe of being able to relive that whole decade one more time.

## Aim
The aim of this exercise was to get to know the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, and learn how to use them in the proper way. Areas covered included:
<ul>
  <li>Tags (for e.g: <head>)/li>
  <li>Proper indenting</li>
  <li>Using custom colours and fonts for the content and/or background</li>
  <li>Making a page responsive to different screen widths</li>
</ul> 

## Key points

I made sure to indent my project completely, using proper headers. I also made sure to connect my CSS stylesheet using the proper stylesheet href in my head.
    
For my CSS stylesheet, I made sure to import the right google fonts link, in addition to adding the @media sections below for responsiveness, and including a separate design section for each of the features on my profile.
